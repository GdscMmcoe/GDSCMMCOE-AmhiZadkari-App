    <string name="q3">What work does AmhiZadkari do?</string>
    <string name="a3"> AmhiZadkari is a government-registered NGO that focuses mostly on tree conservation and plantation. Our main goal is to locate uninhabited areas where large, traditional, jungle-like trees can grow in order to compensate for the natural environment\'s ongoing loss of forest cover. At this stage, we look at plantations on numerous locations around Maharashtra. We also offer a variety of tree-related events, such as gatherings to collect seeds, spread awareness, and more. To get a sneak peak at our activities, use the social media links to see our instagram account.</string>
    <string name="q4">How can you Contribute to AmhiZadkari? </string>
    <string name="a4"> By being involved in the revolution of the tree plantation, you can support this worthy cause. The obvious method is that. Additionally, you can submit donations using any standard form. However, we urge participants to come on-site and volunteer a hand or two at the event instead of just making monetary donations âœ¨âœ¨\nYou may help by providing information about potential plantation locations and by letting us know if you have any ideas that we can put into action together. We are always there to assist you.</string>
